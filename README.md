# Smart IoT Lab Automation

## Overview

The Smart IoT Lab Automation project is a comprehensive system designed to enhance power efficiency, security, student monitoring, and inventory management in a laboratory setting. This project achieved a 30% reduction in power consumption and improved security without manual intervention. The project was awarded Third Prize in the University Projects Expo, competing against 400 teams.

## Features

- **Power Efficiency**: Automated systems to monitor and reduce power usage, achieving a 30% reduction in consumption.
- **Security**: Enhanced security measures with minimal manual intervention.
- **Student Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of student activities within the lab.
- **Inventory Management**: Efficient tracking and management of lab inventory.

## Technologies Used

- **IoT Controllers**: Programmed using C++.
- **Server Side**: Developed using Python 3.
- **Blynk IoT Cloud**: Utilized for designing web interfaces and configuring automation via API calls.

## System Architecture

The system architecture consists of IoT controllers interfacing with various lab equipment and sensors, communicating with a central server that processes data and automates tasks. The Blynk IoT Cloud provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring and control.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- IoT Controllers (e.g., Arduino, ESP8266)
